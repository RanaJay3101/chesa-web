		Procedure: `The team would be given an amount of ₹5000. This amount will be used for bidding on various commodities.
The event comprises of 5 rounds:
Initial four rounds will be used for buying the commodities through auction.
In last round, reverse bidding will be there.
In all rounds, the bidding will be done for a lot of commodities (1 lot = 5 kgs).
The team with highest amount will win the bid for the particular commodity. The base price for 1 lot of commodities will be shared with the teams.


In 1st Round:
• The bidding will start from the base price. 


In 2nd Round:
• The base price of particular commodity will be given & bidding will start on base price.


In 3rd Round:
• The base price of particular commodity will be given & bidding will start on base price.


In 4th Round (only if needed):
• In this round, if there is any unpurchased product, the bidding will be done on them. 
• After the end of 4th round, the news regarding commodities will be shared with all the teams.


In 5th Round:


• At the start of 5th round, the news regarding commodities will be shared with all the teams.
• In this round, we will be having reverse bidding. The commodity purchased by the team will be selling their product to the companies provided.
• The price will be decided by the company. The team can decide whether they want to sell the product or not.
The current price (fluctuated price) will be declared after 5th round on the basis of the news provided.

Result: The winners will be decided on the basis of which team has maximum profit balance. If the commodity is not sold to the company in 5th round, then the price of the commodity will be considered same as the current price(fluctuated price) and will be considered in that team capital.`,
