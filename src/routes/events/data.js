Our Bombay box cricket tournament is a fast-paced and action- packed variation of the traditional sport that is sure to provide hours of entertainment for players and spectators alike.
Our tournament will take place in a rectangular room or closed-off area with artificial turf or matting covering the floor. The walls of the room serve as boundaries, and hitting the ball off the walls is a legitimate way to score runs. Each team will consist of six to eight players, and the game will be played with a soft ball, typically a tennis ball.
The rules of the tournament will be modified to suit the indoor setting, but the basic principles of cricket will remain the same. Each team will get to bat and bowl for a set number of overs, usually six or eight overs per side. The team with the most runs at the end of their innings will win the game.
Fielding is an important aspect of box cricket, and players can be positioned anywhere around the playing area. The bowler must bowl underarm, and the batsman must hit the ball with a flat bat. Scoring runs is the same as traditional cricket, with singles, doubles, fours, and sixes. Our bombay box cricket tournament is perfect for social events or indoor sports competitions. It's a great way to bring people together and get everyone involved in a fun and exciting activity. Plus, it's suitable for people of all ages and skill levels, so everyone can join in the fun!
So, whether you're a seasoned cricketer or a complete beginner, come and join us for our bombay box cricket event and experience the thrill of this unique and exciting variation of the sport, organized by the Chemical Engineering department of Nirma University.`,
		Brief: `Bombay Box Cricket is a form of cricket sport that is played indoors or inside a boundary of the net. It is basically a miniature version of cricket played for fun during leisure time.`,

•	In 1st Round:
• The bidding will start from the base price. 


•	In 2nd Round:
•     The base price of particular commodity will be given & bidding will start on base price.


•	In 3rd Round:

•	In this round, we will be having reverse bidding. The commodity purchased by the team will be selling their product to the companies provided.
•	The price will be decided by the company. The team can decide whether they want to sell the product or not.
The current price(fluctuated price) will be declared after 5th round on the basis of the news provided.

Result: The winners will be decided on the basis of which team has maximum profit balance. If the commodity is not sold to the company in 5th round, then the price of the commodity will be considered same as the current price(fluctuated price) and will be considered in that team capital.`,

Participants in this competition will showcase their knowledge and creativity by designing and building small toy cars powered by chemical reactions. These chemo cars will race down a specially designed track, with the goal of crossing the finish line first.

Participants will work in teams to design and construct their chemo cars, utilizing their knowledge of chemical reactions and principles of engineering.

The judging criteria will include not only the speed of the cars but also their design, creativity, and use of chemical reactions. Judges will consist of faculty members and industry experts in the field of chemistry.

In addition to the thrill of the race, this event provides an opportunity for students to connect with other like-minded individuals in the department and showcase their skills to potential employers. Prizes will be awarded to the winning teams.

So come join us for an exciting day of racing and chemical fun! Whether you're a participant or a spectator, this event is sure to be an unforgettable experience


RULEBOOK OF ROAD RASH:
Chemically Powered Car Racing
● All participants must be registered students in an Institution.
● A team can have only 2 members
● There is no limit on the number of teams that can participate from the same Institute.
● The objective of this competition is to demonstrate the use of energy released from a chemical
reaction.The only energy source for the propulsion of the car should be the energy released from
a chemical reaction.This chemical reactant species can be a solid, liquid, or vapor.
● All teams will be required to build their model beforehand for the competition.
● Fuel Cells: Any vehicle that is purchased from a vendor without major modifications to its
operation will be disqualified. For example a team could not purchase a fuel cell car and race this
car without any modifications. Any team that purchases a commercial fuel cell or builds their
own fuel cell must synthesize the fuel that is used; example, if the team purchases a commercial
methanol fuel cell, they must synthesize the methanol and provide verification of their
procedure.
● Commercial batteries: No commercial batteries of any kind (for example, AA batteries) are
allowed as a power source.
● No Mechanical brakes: No mechanical force can be applied to the wheel, gears, driveshaft,
etc., or ground to slow or stop the car (e.g. no brakes).
● On-board computer control systems (ex Arduino or Raspberry Pi unit) are allowed but must
not in any way control/ measure the distance traveled. The program must be loaded onto the
controller/computer/processor prior to the competition, and the settings may not be changed once
the competition begins, which is defined as the time when the distance is announced.
● Encoder Teams are also not allowed to use an encoder to regulate the velocity of the vehicle in
order to control the distance.
● Wired or wireless communication with the on-board computer/controller is not allowed once
the competition begins and during the competition.
● The car must be an autonomous vehicle and cannot be controlled remotely. Pushing to start the
vehicle or using a mechanical starting device is not allowed. “Bleeding” the time off at the
starting line or prior to the starting line is prohibited. Raising the vehicle at the starting line to
allow the wheels to begin turning is not allowed.

● Both the chemical reaction propelling the vehicle and the start/stop reaction (if there is one)
must be physically on the vehicle during the competition (i.e., pre-loading of a drive system such
as a capacitor assembly is not allowed).
● The vehicle must be powered by a chemical reaction and must be stopped by a quantifiable
change, and direct control, of the concentration of a chemical species.
● The car must start moving, traverse the distance, and come to a stop within a 1 minute time
interval.
● If the car starts going backwards at the starting line, the score will count as 0m traveled.
● Any practice of unfair means will result in the disqualification of the team.
● In case of any discrepancies or objections, the decision of the panel will be final and abiding.`,
